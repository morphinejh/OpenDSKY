# CustomDSKY - Adapted for Nano Every

## Work In Progress
Make sure to get the release version for verified working functionality. Anything else may not function as you expect - make sure to read the change logs.

## Why the 'Nano Every' vs the 'Nano'
One big driving factor for me is that the Nano Every is cheaper than the Nano at this time. Other big advantages are the dedicated Serial port for USB vs I/O - this allows talking to the GPS simultaneously with the host computer,allowing for remote commands and monitoring. The Nano Every also has more programm space and more memory to add new features.
